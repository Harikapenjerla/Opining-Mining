# Project Title: Opinion Mining 
## Objective: 
Our objective is to determine how the people in United State are reacting towards the Pandemic, for example, people tweets praises for doctors and nurses on how helpful they are, how the stay at home have helped in controlling the spread on Virus, etc. In the similar way there are negative tweets as well which we are trying to find. Hence, we are looking for the change in Sentiments of Public based on COVID-19, and the measures implemented for it.
## Goal: 
Our goal is to check the awareness the mass has about the Corona Pandemic and how people are accepting the changes that took place. And therefore, this sentiment of the people will be one of the factors which will help government officials and the general public in making decisions in controlling the situation.
## Details:
•	 The twitter API provided with the last 7 days tweets only. So, we had to extract the data every few days to see the trend. Also the data fetched included the multi-language data but in English script hence during labelling the data as positive and negative some of the data actually does not make any sense so we had to clean the data using various majors.
•	The huge dataset could not be computed using the normal machines. Thus, we had to sample the dataset into parts to execute the models. But even though the model tends to overfit very fast and the information learning rate was less in sample set.

Using available resources, we sampled the data and proceeded for the analysis and modeling. For more details:
